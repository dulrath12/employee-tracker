# employee-tracker

## Description
The goal of this project was to create an employee-tracker/management system using node.js and mySQL. This program allows for departments, employees, and roles to be added that include the names of the department, the name of the role, the full name of the employee along with the corresponding role, salary, and managers name. this program would allow for easy tracking and editing of a companies roster. overall it was a fun project to see how to get certain programs and modules to work within and along side other programs and modules. the biggest obstacle i ran into was having to figure out how to roll back the npm module inquirer to a previous version to get it to work properly. the program works like it should, displays data like it should, and also has all of the bonus objectives included.
